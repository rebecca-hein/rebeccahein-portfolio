abstract: This study aims to evaluate the usability and user experience of the InteractionSuitcase. This is a collection of virtual objects that have cultural connotations (associated with German or Anglo-American culture). They are intended to promote communication about cultural differences and similarities in English lessons at German schools. They are thus part of a didactic concept for using social VR for trans- and intercultural learning. Future teachers used the virtual objects during a practical seminar and rated them helpful to support trans- and intercultural encounters. Further, they associate a positive user experience. Since the virtual objects should encourage communication, the sense of connectedness instead of isolation is a meaningful result. The results proved the readiness of the InteractionSuitcase for further pedagogical applications.
